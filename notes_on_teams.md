# team notes

starting with assignment 2 work will be done in teams.

you may pick your own teams as long as they meet the following stipulations.

- teams cannot be larger than 3 people
- teams can contain only one student in the development stream

please make sure to include a .txt file with every submission that includes the
names, student numbers and email addresses of every team member.

Your team developer will be the team leader, but I expect every team member to
contribute to the assignments.
