es6 brought several important changes to the JavaScript programming language and
the JavaScript community at large adopted the new features and syntax incredibly quickly.

significant changes watching the quick video tutorials below should help get
you up to speed, for more in depth explanations and even more modern features
the book below is a good resource.
